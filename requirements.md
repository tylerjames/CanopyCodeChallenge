# Movie Theatre Implementation

## Requirements

Let's say we have a movie theatre. The movie theatre can have the following things:

-   Rooms with a designated capacity (number of seats)
-   Movies that are playing at a set time every day
-   Tickets that are sold to customers

As a theatre administrator, I would like to

-   Set up rooms
-   Set up movie showtimes
-   Sell some tickets

As a theatre customer, I would like to:

-   Look at the list of movie rooms and what they're playing
-   Look at the list of movies playing at the theatre
-   Buy tickets to a movie

What we're looking for is an API-only implementation of the service, written in Django. We are not looking for real payments, nor do we care about separating user roles - the API can be anonymous. We would like to see testing, though. The whole thing should take 3 days, so you can submit your response by Monday end of day.

The result can be hosted on Github or you can send us a compressed repository (be sure to include the .git/ subdirectory). Thanks and let us know when you're done!
